LuaService
A framework for running a Lua script as a Windows Service.

This is a pre-alpha snapshot of LuaService.

All the documentation is provided through Doxygen, and drawn from 
source code comments and the files in the dox folder which provide
some overview and background topics. For best readability, have
Doxygen build its document set and start browsing it by opening 
the file doc\html\index.html in your favorite browser.
